        <p>HTML5, CSS3, and whatever come with and after them are going to once again change the way we build web sites and apps, and in ways that are just a profound as the transition to Ajax for dynamic interactions. </p>
        <p>This talk discusses what we'll be using JavaScript less (and more) for in the years to come and how mobile, the Chrome Web Store, and Google Chrome Frame will accelerate the transition</p>

        <p>This talk is a gentle introduction into the nebulous topic of the peer to peer web. We'll have a look at mobile devices, laptops, desktops and the cloud and how they all fit together today and how it it is already shaping up to look in the future.</p>
        <p>I'll highlight some technical and social hurdles that need solving (this is where I hope to get you, the listener engaged in helping to shape the future).</p>
        <p>Finally, I'll propose how Apache CouchDB is one of the foundational building blocks of our peer to peer future.</p>

        <p>More and more web applications are seeing the opportunities that can arise from exposing their features on third party websites.  We've already seen a lot of read-only 'badges' that allow third parties sites to display information from your application but now companies like Facebook, Twitter and Linkedin are allowing users of 3rd party sites to actually use their applications without leaving the site. We'll dig in to what it takes to responsibly and effectively embed your application's functionality in other sites, looking at the arcane technology that powers the Like, Share and Tweet buttons going all the way through to implementing full JavaScript APIs to your application in the style of @anywhere, Facebook Connect and Linkedin's JSAPI.</p>

        <p>Graphically intensive and fast paced browser games written in pluginless JavaScript largely do not exist yet, for a very specific reason â€“ performance issues.</p>
        <p>Only recently, browser engines started to give us enough quirks and hacks to power full motion graphics, animation and real time interaction. With unprecedented depth, you'll learn why Canvas isn't the obvious choice, why you should write JavaScript in front- and backend, why HTML5 really is just a buzzword and how to leverage CSS hardware accelerated to create true platform independent games. Dive in to the world of JavaScript gaming!</p>

        <p>We know the future of the web is mobile, but what's the future of mobile? In this session, you'll learn how to step-up mobile app development with widgets and device APIs. Add these two technologies to your toolbox to begin building next-gen mobile apps today.</p>

        <p>With more than 4.6 billion handsets on the planet, we know the future of the web is mobile, but what's the future of mobile? The latest builds of mobile browsers include HTML5 APIs, which enable speedy hardware-accelerated CSS, offline capability, client-side storage, geolocation and other goodies. But, what's next?</p>

        <p>Two web technologies are ushering in the next generation of mobile apps: widgets and device APIs. As self-contained web apps, widgets significantly improve user experience. Device APIs do more than extend web apps to mobile devices. They allow access to native device sensors, like the accelerometer and camera, and to data such as photos and contacts. By adding widgets and device APIs to your toolbox, you can start building sophisticated mobile apps now.</p>

        <p>In this session, PhoneGap hacker Brian LeRoux will guide you through the step-by-step creation of a W3C widget. He'll show you how to combine it with device APIs and deploy it using the PhoneGap open source framework. Learn how to develop for the mobile web of the future, today.</p>
