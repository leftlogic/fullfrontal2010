        <h4>Who is this workshop for?</h4>
        <p>If you're a web developer, mobile developer, mobile designer or a project manager in charge of mobile development, then PhoneGap training is for you.</p>
        <p>If you're already well-versed in JavaScript and HTML, PhoneGap provides the fastest, most effective way to add mobile application development to your roster, especially if you're building social networking applications, simple games and companion applications to websites.</p>
        <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
        <p>Developers should have basic HTML and JavaScript experience. Training sessions are instructor led, with  hands-on exercises. Students will need their own laptops and mobile phones to participate.</p>
        <p>Students are encouraged to get a head start by downloading the appropriate mobile SDKs for each platform - SDKs and IDEs are cross-platform compatible, unless otherwise indicated:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><em>iPhone</em>: <a href="http://developer.apple.com/technology/xcode.html" target="_blank">Xcode and the iPhone SDK</a>. <strong>Mac only*</strong></li>
        <li><em>Android</em>: <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" target="_blank">Android SDK</a> (1.6 recommended) and the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp" target="_blank">Java SE Development Kit</a>. Highly recommended: the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Eclipse IDE</a> and the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/1.5_r2/installing.html" target="_blank">ADT Android Eclipse Plug-in</a>.</li>
        <li><em>Blackberry</em>: Requires <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Eclipse 3.4 or 3.41</a> for Windows (please ensure you download the correct version) and the <a href="http://na.blackberry.com/eng/developers/javaappdev/javaeclipseplug.jsp" target="_blank">Java Eclipse</a>
        plug-ins, including Component Packs v4.6.1 and v4.7. The Blackberry
        development environment can be quite challenging to set up - please see
        <a href="http://phonegap.pbworks.com/Getting+Started+with+PhoneGap+%28BlackBerry%29" target="_blank">our tutorial</a> for assistance. <strong>Windows only</strong>*</li>
        <li><em>Symbian</em>: You can develop PhoneGap apps for Symbian without any external software, using Nokia's Web Runtime (WRT). However, <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/Tools_Docs_and_Code/Tools/Runtimes/Web_Runtime/Aptana_Plugin/QuickStart.xhtml" target="_blank">Aptana Studio and the Nokia WRT plug-in</a> are recommended to ease development. Further information is available in <a href="http://phonegap.pbworks.com/Getting-Started-with-Phonegap-Nokia-WRT" target="_blank">our Symbian tutorial</a>.</li>
        <li><em>Palm</em>: <a href="http://developer.palm.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1545">VirtualBox and the webOS SDK.</a></li>

        <h4>Workshop Details</h4>
        <p>HTML5 has gained a lot of attention over the last 12 months. With browsers increasingly supporting the features of the vast JavaScript APIs both in and around the official HTML5 spec, it's making the job of creating awesome applications purely using these web technologies very easy indeed.</p>
        <p>This full day workshop will introduce you to HTML5 with a brief backstory, before diving into the APIs one by one. As well as going through code and showing practical demonstrations, where possible, we'll also talk about the alternatives for old browsers that don't support "awesome" out of the box.</p>

        <h4>What will be covered?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Video &amp; audio – move over Flash</li>
          <li>Canvas – bring on the Mario games</li>
          <li>Storage – like cookies, but tastes so much better</li>
          <li>Offline – forget the web</li>
          <li>Geolocation – finders keepers</li>
          <li>Web Workers – multithreading for the browser</li>
          <li>Web Sockets – pushing data was never so easy</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Who is this workshop for?</h4>
        <p>You're not expected to have played with HTML5 just yet, but you will need to have a reasonable understanding of HTML &amp; JavaScript. A lot of the individual APIs are being used in popular web sites today both in desktop browsers and mobile, so rest assured that this applies to developers that are working on the web <em>today</em>.</p>     
        <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
        <p>Delegates will need their own laptop and copies of the latest browsers - at the very least <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari 5</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome 5</a></p>
